// 4. DrRacket as a calculator
25
25 - 20
25 + 20
25 * 20
25 / 20

// Exercise 3
// Add the numbers 123 and 456 together.
123 + 456

// Exercise 4
// Add the numbers 123, 456, and 789 together.
123 + 456 + 789


// 5. Chaining Operations
// we can use the results of previous operations in the next operation(s).
// 100 - 45

// we can combine multiple operations in the same line.
// 100 - (25 + 20)
// (5 * 4) - 1

// Chaining operations is the computer science equivalent of taking 2 parts and putting them together.
// When building big programs we will build them in parts and put the parts together.

// Exercise 5
// multiply 10 by the sum of the numbers 123 and 456.
10 * (123 + 456)

// Exercise 6
// add the number 123, 456, and 789 together, but do not give the + operation more than 2 inputs at once. Instead, use the + operation twice, each time with just 2 inputs.
123 + (456 + 789)

// Exercise 7
// What is wrong with each of the following formulas?
// (3 + 2) // nothing

// (5) -> nothing 

// ((+ 3 2)) // -> prefix instead of infix


// 6. The definitions window
// The bottom half of drracket (the interactions window).
// The top half (the definitions window) is for anything you want to save/run/reuse later.
// The top half is basically a text editor.
// You can save the code in the top half to be reused later.
// To run your code, either press the run button or cmd + r.

// Exercise 8
// Put the 4 formulas you made above in the Definitions Window. Make sure that when you click the Run button, the Interactions Window shows exactly 4 results
// 579
// 1368
// 5790
// 1368
// in that order.


// 7. Comments
// Another thing you could do in the definitions window is putting text that helps us understand what is going on.
// To tell the computer to ignore the text, put 2 forward slashes in front of the text you want to ignore.
// Anything to the right of the 2 forward slashes is ignored. The ignore text is called a comment.
// You can also use /**/ to write multiline comments.

(5 * 4) - 1

// Exercise 9
// In the Definitions Window, put the comments
// Exercise 3
// Exercise 4
// Exercise 5
// Exercise 6
// above each of the 4 formulas, so that it is easy for people to see which formula is for which exercise above.
// These comments should be ignored by DrRacket, so make sure that when you click the Run button, the Interactions Window shows the same 4 results as before.


// 8. Stepping
// 100 - (25 + 20) -> we are chaining additiong and subtraction.
// It is useful to write the results of the operations step by step.

// remaining cash

(5 * 4) - 1
// 20 - 1

// 9. Images
// todo: images
// We can also use a programming language to calculate with images (wip).
// to work with images we need to add
// import "../image.rhm" open
